## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Happy Path**: Complete entire form and submit successfully
2. **Navigation**: Test back/forward navigation through steps
3. **Validation**: Try to proceed with invalid/incomplete data
4. **File Upload**: Test with various file types and sizes
5. **Draft Save**: Close browser and return to verify draft restoration
6. **Responsive**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
7. **Error Handling**: Test with network disconnected

### Edge Cases
- No student profile (should redirect to onboarding)
- No programs available (should show empty state)
- File too large (should show error)
- Invalid file type (should reject)
- Network error during submission (should handle gracefully)
- Browser refresh during form (should restore draft)

## üìà Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- In-browser document preview
- Program comparison feature
- Application templates for common scenarios
- Multi-language support
- Mobile app version
- OCR for document data extraction
- AI-powered SOP review and suggestions
- Real-time validation with university APIs

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Student profile not found"**
- User needs to complete onboarding first
- Navigate to `/student/onboarding`

**"Failed to upload document"**
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Verify file type is supported (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG)

**"Draft not restoring"**
- Ensure localStorage is enabled in browser
