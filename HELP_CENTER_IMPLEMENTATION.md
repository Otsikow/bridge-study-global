# Help Center Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive Help Center page with FAQs loaded from Supabase, a Contact Form that posts to support_tickets table, and quick action links.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `/workspace/supabase/migrations/20251025000000_create_help_center_tables.sql`

Created two new tables:
- **`faqs`** table: Stores frequently asked questions with categories and display order
- **`support_tickets`** table: Stores support requests from users

Features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic timestamps with triggers
- Sample FAQ data seeded
- Proper indexing for performance
- Multi-tenant support

### 2. Help Center Page
**File:** `/workspace/src/pages/HelpCenter.tsx`

A full-featured Help Center page with:

#### Sections:
1. **Quick Actions** - Three clickable cards:
   - Talk to an Agent (links to `/student/messages`)
   - Track My Application (links to `/student/applications`)
   - Live Chat (placeholder for future implementation)

2. **FAQs Tab**:
   - Search functionality to filter FAQs
   - Clean collapsible Accordion UI
   - Category badges for organization
   - Loaded dynamically from Supabase `faqs` table
   - Real-time filtering by question, answer, or category

3. **Contact Support Tab**:
   - Form with validation (name, email, subject, message)
   - Posts to `support_tickets` table
   - Character counter for message field
   - Auto-fills email if user is logged in
   - Additional contact information (email and phone support)

#### Features:
- Responsive design
- Dark mode compatible
- Loading states
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Form validation using Zod
- Authentication check before submission
- Beautiful gradient background
- Icon-driven UI

### 3. Routing
**File:** `/workspace/src/App.tsx`

Added:
- Import for HelpCenter page component
- Route at `/help` for the Help Center page

### 4. Footer Navigation
**File:** `/workspace/src/components/layout/AppFooter.tsx`

Added:
- Help Center link in the Support section with HelpCircle icon
- Positioned prominently in the footer navigation

## Database Schema

### FAQs Table
```sql
faqs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID,
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

### Support Tickets Table
```sql
support_tickets (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject TEXT,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT (open, in_progress, resolved, closed),
  priority TEXT (low, normal, high, urgent),
  assigned_to UUID,

)
```

## Access Points

Users can access the Help Center through:
1. Direct URL: `/help`
2. Footer: "Support" section â†’ "Help Center" link
3. Navigation (can be added to main nav if desired)

## Sample FAQs Seeded

The migration includes 8 sample FAQs covering:
- Getting Started
- Support
- Visa & Immigration
- Applications (3 FAQs)
- Payments
- Security

## Security

- RLS policies ensure users can only:
  - View active FAQs from their tenant
  - View their own support tickets
  - Create tickets for themselves
  - Admins/staff can manage all FAQs and tickets
- Form validation on both client and server
- Authentication required for ticket submission

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add real live chat integration (currently placeholder)
2. Email notifications when tickets are created/updated
3. Admin panel for managing FAQs
4. Ticket status tracking page for users
5. Rich text editor for FAQ answers
6. Attachments support for tickets
7. Canned responses for common issues
8. FAQ voting system (helpful/not helpful)
9. Related articles suggestions
10. Ticket priority auto-detection using AI
