# Authentication System Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Default Tenant**
- **Problem**: The `handle_new_user()` function was failing because no default tenant existed in the database
- **Fix**: Created migration to ensure a default tenant exists and updated the function to handle missing tenants gracefully

### 2. **Profile Creation Failures**
- **Problem**: When profile creation failed, users couldn't log in because no profile existed
- **Fix**: Added robust error handling and fallback profile creation in the `useAuth` hook

### 3. **Role Assignment Issues**
- **Problem**: Role selection wasn't properly passed to the database during signup
- **Fix**: Updated signup form to include role selection and pass it to Supabase metadata

### 4. **Missing Database Policies**
- **Problem**: RLS policies were preventing profile creation during signup
- **Fix**: Added policies to allow profile and role-specific record creation during signup

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Signup Component** (`src/pages/auth/Signup.tsx`):
   - Added role selection dropdown (Student, Agent, Staff)
   - Updated form submission to pass role information
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

2. **Updated useAuth Hook** (`src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`):
   - Enhanced `signUp` function to accept role parameter
   - Added `createProfileForUser` function for fallback profile creation
   - Improved error handling in `signIn` and `signUp` functions
   - Added better logging for debugging

3. **Updated Login Component** (`src/pages/auth/Login.tsx`):
   - Improved user feedback messages
   - Added better error handling

### Database Changes

1. **Created Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20250122000000_fix_authentication_system.sql`):
   - Ensures default tenant exists
   - Updates `handle_new_user()` function with better error handling
   - Adds necessary RLS policies for signup
   - Fixes existing users without proper role assignments

2. **Database Setup Guide** (`DATABASE_SETUP.md`):
   - Step-by-step instructions to manually apply database fixes
   - SQL commands to run in Supabase SQL editor

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Manual Database Setup (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL commands from `DATABASE_SETUP.md`
4. Test the authentication system

### Option 2: Use the Migration
1. If you have Supabase CLI set up locally, run the migration
2. Or manually apply the migration SQL to your database

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test User Signup
1. Go to `/auth/signup`
2. Fill out the form with:
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: testpassword123
   - Account Type: Student (or Agent/Staff)
3. Submit the form
4. Check that you receive a success message
5. Check your email for verification (if email confirmation is enabled)

### 2. Test User Login
1. Go to `/auth/login`
2. Use the credentials from the signup test
3. Submit the form
4. Check that you're redirected to the dashboard
5. Verify that your profile is loaded correctly

### 3. Test Role Assignment
1. Sign up users with different roles (Student, Agent, Staff)
2. Check the database to verify:
   - Profile is created in `profiles` table
   - Role is assigned in `user_roles` table
   - Role-specific record is created (e.g., `students` table for students)

### 4. Test Google OAuth
1. Try signing up with Google
2. Verify that profile is created with default role
3. Test login with Google account

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Default tenant exists in database
- [ ] `handle_new_user()` function is updated
- [ ] RLS policies allow profile creation
- [ ] Signup form includes role selection
- [ ] Profile creation works for all roles
- [ ] Login works for all user types
- [ ] Role-specific records are created
- [ ] Google OAuth works
- [ ] Error handling is robust

## Troubleshooting

### If signup still fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database policies are applied
3. Check Supabase logs for function errors
4. Ensure default tenant exists

### If login fails:
1. Check if profile was created during signup
2. Verify user role assignment
3. Check RLS policies for profile access

### If role assignment fails:
1. Verify role is passed in signup metadata
2. Check `handle_new_user()` function logs
3. Ensure role-specific tables exist

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes:
1. Test all authentication flows thoroughly
2. Monitor Supabase logs for any errors
3. Consider adding more robust error handling
4. Add user onboarding flows for different roles
5. Implement role-based dashboard routing

The authentication system should now work properly for all user roles (students, agents, and staff) with proper profile creation, role assignment, and access control.
