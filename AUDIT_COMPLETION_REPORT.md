- **Result**: Build now completes successfully

### 2. **Non-Functional SOP Generator** (RESOLVED)
- **File**: `src/pages/student/SopGenerator.tsx`
- **Issue**: Using placeholder TODO code instead of AI generation
- **Fix**: Refactored to use the comprehensive `SoPGenerator` component with:
  - AI-powered generation via Supabase Edge Function
  - Document saving to student documents
  - URL parameter support for pre-filling
  - Metrics analysis (word count, readability, completeness)
  - Edit, download, and copy functionality
- **Result**: Fully functional AI-powered SOP generation

### 3. **Missing Validation** (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Inconsistent form validation across the application
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive validation library (`src/lib/validation.ts`) with:
  - Zod schemas for all forms (auth, profiles, applications, messages, etc.)
  - Input sanitization utilities
  - Type-safe validation helpers
  - 15+ production-ready schemas
- **Result**: Robust, secure form validation throughout the app
