## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Apply database migrations
supabase migration up
```

### Key Files

```
src/pages/student/NewApplication.tsx              # Main container
src/components/application/PersonalInfoStep.tsx   # Step 1
src/components/application/EducationHistoryStep.tsx   # Step 2
src/components/application/ProgramSelectionStep.tsx   # Step 3
src/components/application/DocumentsUploadStep.tsx    # Step 4
src/components/application/ReviewSubmitStep.tsx       # Step 5
```

### Environment Setup

Required environment variables (in `.env`):
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Database Setup

1. **Apply the storage migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. **Verify storage bucket:**
   - Check Supabase dashboard
   - Bucket name: `application-documents`
   - Should be private with RLS enabled

3. **Verify tables exist:**
   - `applications`
   - `application_documents`
   - `students`
   - `education_records`
   - `programs`
   - `intakes`
   - `notifications`

### Testing the Form

```bash
# 1. Start the dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to:
http://localhost:5173/student/applications/new

# 3. Complete the form
# 4. Check the database for new records
# 5. Verify files uploaded to storage
# 6. Check notifications table
```

## üîß Configuration

### Adjusting File Limits

In `DocumentsUploadStep.tsx`:
```typescript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // Change this
```

In migration file:
```sql
file_size_limit: 10485760, -- Change this
```

### Adding Document Types

In `DocumentsUploadStep.tsx`, update `DOCUMENT_TYPES` array:
```typescript
{
  key: 'new_doc',
  label: 'New Document',
  description: 'Description here',
  required: true,
}
```

Update type in `NewApplication.tsx`:
```typescript
interface Documents {
  transcript: File | null;
  passport: File | null;
  ielts: File | null;
  sop: File | null;
  new_doc: File | null;  // Add this
}
```

### Customizing Validation

Each step component has an `isValid()` function:
```typescript
const isValid = () => {
  // Add your validation logic
  return validationResult;
};
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build fails with module errors
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: Storage bucket doesn't exist
**Solution:**
```bash
supabase migration up
# Or manually create bucket in Supabase dashboard
```

### Issue: RLS policies preventing access
**Solution:**
- Check user is authenticated
- Verify user has student profile
- Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- Verify tenant_id matches

### Issue: Draft not saving
**Solution:**
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify DRAFT_STORAGE_KEY is unique

### Issue: Files not uploading
**Solution:**
- Verify storage bucket exists
- Check file size (<10MB)
- Verify file type is allowed
- Check RLS policies on storage.objects
- Ensure application_id is valid
