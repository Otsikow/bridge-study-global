## 💡 Quick Tips

**Create Different User Types**:
- Students: Choose "Student" during signup
- Agents: Choose "Agent/Counselor" during signup
- Staff/Admin: Must be created manually (see docs)

**Test Different Roles**:
```sql
-- Promote user to admin (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('paste-user-id-here', 'admin')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

**Check Users**:
```sql
-- See all users and their roles
SELECT 
  p.email,
  p.full_name,
  p.role
FROM public.profiles p;
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Still can't login?**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify SQL script ran successfully
4. See `/workspace/AUTHENTICATION_FIX.md` for detailed help

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your authentication system is now fully functional. All user types (students, agents, staff) can now sign up and log in successfully.

**Happy coding!** 🚀
