# Unified Payments Page Implementation

## Overview
A unified Payments page has been successfully created that serves both students and agents with role-specific views.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. **Main Payments Page** (`/src/pages/Payments.tsx`)
- Detects user role from authentication context
- Renders appropriate component based on role:
  - Students → `StudentPayments` component
  - Agents → `AgentPayments` component

### 2. **Student Payments Component** (`/src/components/payments/StudentPayments.tsx`)

#### Features:
- **Payment History Table**: Displays all application fees and payments with:
  - Date, description (program + university), amount, status, receipt link
  - Fetches payments from `payments` table via Supabase
  
- **Summary Cards**:
  - Outstanding Balance (pending payments)
  - Total Paid (succeeded payments)
  - Next Due Date (earliest pending payment)

- **Stripe Integration**: 
  - Placeholder "Add Payment" button for Stripe payment initiation
  - Receipt URL links to Stripe receipts
  - Payment status tracking (pending, succeeded, failed, refunded)

- **Export Functionality**: Export payment history (placeholder)

#### Database Integration:
- Fetches from `payments` table joined with `applications` and `universities`
- Filters by student's applications
- Supports multiple currencies via Intl.NumberFormat

---

### 3. **Agent Payments Component** (`/src/components/payments/AgentPayments.tsx`)

#### Features:

##### **Commission Statistics Cards**:
- **Total Earned**: Sum of all paid commissions (green)
- **Approved**: Commissions ready for payout (blue)
- **Pending**: Awaiting approval (yellow)
- **Students Referred**: Total unique students

##### **Monthly Earnings Graph**:
- Interactive line chart using recharts library
- Shows last 6 months of earnings trends
- Two series: "Earned" and "Pending"
- Month-over-month growth percentage indicator
- Responsive design with tooltips

##### **Commission Details Table**:
- Tabs for filtering: All, Pending, Approved, Paid
- Columns: Date, Student, Program, University, Rate, Amount, Status
- Color-coded status badges
- Breakdown by referred student and application

##### **Request Payout Button**:
- Triggers payout request for approved commissions
- Disabled when no approved commissions available
- Shows loading state during request
- Toast notifications for user feedback

##### **Stripe Connect Integration Section**:
- Information about payout processing
- Connection status indicator
- Processing timeline (2-3 business days)

#### Database Integration:
- Fetches from `commissions` table joined with `applications`, `students`, `universities`
- Filters by agent ID
- Supports commission levels (L1, L2) and different rates
- Status management: pending → approved → paid

---

### 4. **Routing Updates** (`/src/App.tsx`)

Added multiple routes for flexibility:
```tsx
/student/payments  → Payments (students only)
/agent/payments    → Payments (agents only)
/payments          → Payments (students & agents)
```

All routes are protected with role-based access control via `ProtectedRoute` component.

---

### 5. **Navigation Updates** (`/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`)

- **Students**: "Payments" link → `/student/payments`
- **Agents**: "Payments & Commissions" link → `/agent/payments`

---

## Database Schema Used

### **payments** table:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- tenant_id (UUID)
- application_id (UUID)
- stripe_payment_intent (TEXT)
- amount_cents (INTEGER)
- currency (TEXT)
- status (payment_status: pending, succeeded, failed, refunded)
- purpose (payment_purpose: application_fee, service_fee, deposit, tuition, other)
- receipt_url (TEXT)
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

### **commissions** table:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- tenant_id (UUID)
- application_id (UUID)
- agent_id (UUID)
- level (SMALLINT: 1 or 2)
- rate_percent (NUMERIC)
- amount_cents (INTEGER)
- currency (TEXT)
- status (commission_status: pending, approved, paid, clawback)
- approved_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- paid_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

## Stripe Integration Points (To Complete)

### For Students:
1. **Payment Initiation**: 
   - Implement Stripe Checkout or Payment Intent creation
   - Handle payment success/failure webhooks
   - Update `payments` table status

2. **Receipt Generation**: 
   - Auto-populate `receipt_url` from Stripe

### For Agents:
1. **Stripe Connect Setup**:
   - Onboard agents to Stripe Connect
   - Store `stripe_account_id` in agents table

2. **Payout Processing**:
   - Create Stripe Transfer to agent's connected account
   - Update `commissions.paid_at` timestamp
   - Update status from "approved" to "paid"

3. **Webhook Handlers**:
   - `transfer.created` → Track payout initiation
   - `transfer.paid` → Confirm payout completion
   - `transfer.failed` → Handle payout failures
