## Part 1: Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1.1 Critical Issues

#### ❌ **Build Failure - UniversitySearch.tsx**
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Application wouldn't build or deploy

**Problem**: The `UniversitySearch.tsx` file had incomplete JSX code at line 443, causing a syntax error that prevented the application from building.

**Solution**: 
- Completed the missing JSX code for the scholarships section
- Added proper closing tags and structure
- Implemented scholarship display with proper formatting
- Added tabbed interface for AI features (recommendations, SOP generator, interview practice)

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/src/pages/UniversitySearch.tsx`

---

#### ❌ **SOP Generator Using TODO Placeholder**
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Non-functional feature, poor user experience

**Problem**: The SOP Generator page (`/src/pages/student/SopGenerator.tsx`) used a simple placeholder that concatenated user inputs instead of using AI generation.

**Solution**:
- Completely refactored to use the comprehensive `SoPGenerator` component
- Integrated with Supabase Edge Function for AI-powered generation
- Added document saving functionality
- Implemented URL parameter support for pre-filling program and university
- Enhanced with metrics analysis (word count, readability, completeness)
- Added edit, download, and copy functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspace/src/pages/student/SopGenerator.tsx`

**Files Referenced**:
- `/workspace/src/components/ai/SoPGenerator.tsx` (existing, well-implemented component)

---

### 1.2 Performance Issues

#### ⚠️ **No Performance Optimization**
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Slow loading times, poor user experience on slower networks

**Solution**: Created comprehensive performance optimization library with:

- Lazy loading hooks
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Image optimization utilities
- Local storage caching with TTL
- Request batching
- Prefetch capabilities
