# Student Onboarding Guide

This guide explains the process of onboarding a new student to the platform from an agent's perspective.

## 1. Inviting a Student

From your "My Students" dashboard, click the "Invite Student" button. You will be prompted to enter the student's full name, email address, and an optional phone number.

- **Full Name:** The student's legal name.
- **Email Address:** A valid email address where the student can receive their invitation.
- **Phone Number (Optional):** The student's contact phone number.

Once you submit the form, an invitation email is sent to the student.

## 2. Pending Onboarding

After you've invited a student, they will appear in your "My Students" list with a **"Pending onboarding"** status. This means:

- The student has been successfully invited to the platform.
- They have not yet accepted the invitation and completed their profile setup.

## 3. Student Account Activation

The student will receive an email containing a link to activate their account. They will need to:

1.  Click the link in the invitation email.
2.  Set a password for their account.
3.  Complete their student profile with any required information.

## 4. Onboarded

Once the student has completed the steps above, their status in your "My Students" list will automatically change to **"Onboarded"**. At this point, they are ready to start applying to universities through the platform.

## Summary of Statuses

- **Pending onboarding:** The student has been invited but has not yet set up their account.
- **Onboarded:** The student has accepted the invitation, completed their profile, and is ready to start the application process.
